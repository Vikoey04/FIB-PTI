# Recommendations if you want to do the PTI lab assignments on your own computer 

PTI lab assignments are designed to work on Linux (Ubuntu). 

## If you have Windows 10 (Home or any other edition)

a. [WSL2](./wsl.md) may be a very practical way. If you choose WSL2 check [this](./docker_wsl2.md) to be able to use Docker there.

b. A [virtual machine](./virtualmachine.md) may be not so practical but it will provide a more similar environment. 

## If you have Mac

a. A suitable way is to run an Ubuntu Docker container as explained [here](./docker.md). This way you will be able to use exactly the same commands that we provide in the documentation without messing with your OS.

b. Alternativelly, you may try doing things directly on the macOS Terminal. But you will need to find the way to install the necessary tools (with homebrew, etc.). 

c. Of course you can always use a [virtual machine](./virtualmachine.md) or dual boot.
